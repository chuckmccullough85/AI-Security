Welcome to the AI Security Labs repository. This repository contains a series of labs designed to help students understand and apply various concepts in AI security.


## Introduction

In these labs, you will explore different aspects of AI security, including threat modeling, secure development practices, and more. Each lab is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world scenarios.

# Setup
Follow these steps to set up your environment for the AI Security Labs.  Please note the versions required for the labs.  If you have a different version of Python installed, the labs may not work correctly.

## Step 1: Install Python
If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official website.
- [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

> **Note - the labs require version 3.10.0.  If you have installed a different version, the labs will not work correctly.** Make a note of the installation directory.  You will need this information later.

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Don't install Visual Studio (community, professional, or enterprise) - it is a different product.

## Step 3: Download the StudentWork folder
- Download the *StudentWork.zip* file and unzip it into an empty folder.
- Open Visual Studio Code 
- Choose *File/Open Folder...* and open **Labs** in unzipped *StudentWork* folder. 

## Step 4: Install Extensions ![extensions](images/extensions.png)
- VS Code will probably ask to install several extensions.
- Click the *Install* button to install the recommended extensions.

If VSCode did not offer to install the extensions, click the Extensions icon ![extensions](images/extensions.png) on the left side of the window.  Search for the following extensions and install them.

| Extension | Icon |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|Jupyter  (Microsoft) | ![](Images/jupyter.png) |
|Python (Microsoft) | ![](Images/python.png) |
|Python Debugger (Microsoft) | ![](Images/pythondebugger.png) |
|Pylance (Microsoft) | ![](Images/pylance.png) |

## Step 5: Open the setup notebook
- Expand *00-Setup* from the *Explorer* pane on the left.
- Open the *[00-Setup.ipynb](00-Setup/00-Setup.ipynb)* notebook.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the setup.
